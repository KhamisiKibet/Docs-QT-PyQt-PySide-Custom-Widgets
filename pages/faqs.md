Another way is to head over to the [PySide2extn/PyQt5extn Form](https://forms.gle/yfKVK85sLLMJMCfJA) fill up your concern, and we will individually look at the issue and solve it. Please add a valid email, as we may reply you directly for the concern you raised.

8. Can I modify the source code for additional flexibility?

   Yes, you can, but also notify the creator of this package about the same(under [Support Page](https://anjalp.github.io/PySide2extn/pages/help&support#support)) as the idea my be under development.

9. Which OS version is supported?

   The package was manually tested in different OS (Windows(7, 8, 10 2006, 10 20H2), Linux(Ubuntu 20.04)) with different Python version(3.6-3.9) and also different PySide2/PyQt5 package(5.11.0-5.15.0) all the result are given in: [Getting Started/Requirements](https://anjalp.github.io/PySide2extn/pages/get_started#requirements).

10. Does this python package works only with PySide2?

    No. The documentation is fully written for the PySide2 python package, but all the methods/customization and all other things *works exactly the same for the PyQt5 Python package.* The only exception is that the imports should be from the PyQt5 and not from PySide2.
