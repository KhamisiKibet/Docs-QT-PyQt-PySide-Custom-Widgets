As of the Initial Release the extension is equipped with two new Widgets: *Round Progress Bar* and *Spiral Progress Bar*, each of which is fully customizable in aspect of color, style, size and many more.

## Widgets

### *Round Progress Bar*

</p>

PySide2/PyQt5 natively does not support a round progress bar. PySide2extn/PyQt5extn package solves this problem and gives users the ability to add the round progress bar in their existing projects or new ones same as they used to work with other native PySide2/PyQt5 widgets. It can also be used with QtDesigner(refer [Getting Started](pages/get_started#using-with-qtdesigner)). The above image represent the potential of this package for customization of the round progress bar widget.

[See Examples](pages/examples/rpbExamples){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 } [Details](pages/class/rpbClass){: .btn .fs-5 .mb-4 .mb-md-0 }

### *Spiral Progress Bar*

Spiral progress bar concept is similar to that of the round progress bar, except that it has many concentric round progress bars, with individual element customization. The spiral progress bar can be treated as any other PySide2/PyQt5 widget. Check below for more info on the widget.
